<div>
  Automatically jump to the subview selected here rather than showing an intermediate
  page just listing the subviews.  This option streamlines the view navigation, but
  makes it more difficult to return to this edit page.  To do so, click the plus ("+")
  icon at the right of the view tabs (for adding a new subview) and then click the
  "Edit View" link in the sidepanel.
