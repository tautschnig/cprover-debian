  If checked, Jenkins will schedule build even if some upstream project has no successful builds.
  If not checked, Jenkins will not schedule build when some SNAPSHOT if any other
  upstream project has no successful builds on this Jenkins.

  <p>
  This is convenient for automatically performing continuous integration when project has many upstreams
  and broking of one prevents from triggering the build of a downstream even when other upstream has been built
  successfuly. Jenkins may have no knowledge about successful builds for some upstream if builds were cleaned up
  or was not performed after restarts or upgrades. At the same time this project can be build because
  the upstream artifacts are present in MAVEN repository.

  <p>
  This behaviour may trigger extra builds. If this behavior is problematic, uncheck this option.
