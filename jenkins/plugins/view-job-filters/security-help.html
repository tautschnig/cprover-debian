<div>
Filter jobs in a view by the permissions the current user has for that job.
<br/><br/>
For example, you could create the following types views
<ul>
<li><u>Your Configurable Jobs</u> - Select "Configure", and "Include Matched"</li>
<li><u>Your Read-Only Jobs</u> - Select "Match At Least One", "Configure", "Build", "Workspace", and "Include Unmatched"</li>
<li><u>Your Buildable Jobs</u> - Select "Build", and "Include Matched"</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
And, of course, you can chain this filter with other filters to create whatever filter is useful to your organization.
<br/><br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> This filter does not <u>provide</u> security - it merely provides convenient views that feed off of the security you've already set up.
