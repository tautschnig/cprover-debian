<div>
This filter allows you to create a view consisting of jobs that are related through the concept of Upstream/Downstream (also called "Build after other projects are built" and "Build other projects").
<br/>
The options provided allow you to choose exactly which types of related jobs to show.
<br/><br/>
<u>Note</u> that filters are chained together, so using this filter builds off of the jobs included by previous filters.  Remember that
<ul>
	<li>This filter will not include any jobs if there are no jobs already selected</li>
	<li>This filter (like most other filters) is capable of removing jobs that were already selected</li>
</ul>
