<div>
Organize views by the their build status over time. Some examples of views you could create:
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>All jobs that ran in the last 3 hours.</li>
	<li>All jobs that have been stable for the last 10 builds.</li>
	<li>All jobs that have at least one non-stable build in the last week.</li>
	<li>All jobs that have not been run in the last 7 days. (Using the Match Type)</li>
	<li>All jobs that have not been triggered by an SCM change for 30 days.</li>
	<li>All jobs that were last triggered by a remote trigger.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
For the "How far back to check" value, use either "0" or blank to indicate you want to check all builds. 
<br/><br/>
Note that not all combinations of criteria will make sense.  Also, if this filter seems more complicated than what you need, 
you might try either the "Build Statuses Filter" or the "Job Statuses Filter".
