  Use Regular Expressions to include or exclude parameterized jobs based on their build parameters.  
  Match the parameter name, build value, or description.  Alternately, you may opt to depend on the default configured value.

  For the name, value, and description - a blank indicates you do not care about that field - it 
  behaves as if you had assigned it the regular expression ".*".

  This filter works with String, Boolean, File, Choice, and Validating String parameter types.
