This filter allows you to base one view's jobs off of other view's jobs.  
This is mostly helpful in large organizations with hundreds of jobs, and many views.
<br/><br/>
For example, if you have a company organizational hierarchy of projects, different configuration managers might
want to view a different sub-set of jobs, and there's no reason to manage each view's list of jobs if some views
are simply meant to be an aggregate of other views.
<br/><br/>
Another example is if you have one "special" view that contains utility or legacy jobs, and you want to easily exclude those
jobs from other views, but there are no well-defined characteristics of those jobs that you can filter on.  With this filter,
you can put your effort into creating that special view, and then for other views simply choose to exclude all jobs that
appear in that special view.
<br/><br/>
<b>Do not select a view as it's own "Other View"</b> - this can cause unpredictable behavior.
