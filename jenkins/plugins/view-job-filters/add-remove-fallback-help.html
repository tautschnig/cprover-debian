<div>
<p>It is useful to place this filter after other filters, which sometimes may include all jobs or
no jobs.Based on its configuration, this filter can do one of the following things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add all jobs to this view if no jobs are included by the previous filters.</li>
    <li>Remove all jobs from this view if all jobs are included by the previous filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>This filter does not affect the list of jobs in the other cases. In other words, this filter
can act as a fallback filter that ensures that this view either never will be empty or never will
contain all jobs.</p>
