Create views that are most relevant to the logged-in user.

The "<b>Name Matching</b>" checkbox items are to allow you to get the name matching just right.  The problem is that
organization often have different naming conventions that may not be consistent across version control, 
network logins, and email addresses.  All of the options are checked by default so that this filter
can make a thorough effort to find matching users. 
<br/><br/>
The "<b>Relevance Matching</b>" options should be self explanatory.  The point is to try and find
all jobs that the logged in user cares about, based on their activity.
<br/><br/>
For the "How far back to check" value, use either "0" or blank to indicate you want to check all builds. 
<br/><br/>
Note that not all combinations of criteria will make sense.  Also take a look at the "User Permissions for Jobs" filter.
