    <p>
        If this option is checked, Jenkins makes it possible to set an environment
        for the build job (or for each run on a matrix project) by defining environment variables and execute a script
        (a setup script).<br/>
        All these actions will be executed before a SCM checkout.<br/>
        By default, after the set up, only injected variables (with Jenkins variables) will be available in the build
        scripts, in the Jenkins post-actions, and so on. <br/>

        Default inherited environment variables (inherited variables by
        the Jenkins process which often contains machine-specific information,
        like PATH, TIMEZONE, etc.) can be unset if you enable
        the 'envInject' property and check 'Unset system variables'
        in the node configuration page.
